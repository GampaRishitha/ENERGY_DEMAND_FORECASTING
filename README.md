# ENERGY_DEMAND_FORECASTING

# Time Series Analysis of Solar Generation and Load Data

## Overview
This project analyzes time-series data related to solar energy generation and electrical load in Italy for the year 2016. The dataset includes timestamps, load values, and solar generation values, allowing us to explore trends, patterns, and relationships between energy consumption and production.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze trends in energy consumption and solar generation
- Create time series visualizations to understand fluctuations over time
- Implement statistical and machine learning models for forecasting
- Utilize data preprocessing techniques for cleaning and feature engineering

## Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Converting timestamps to appropriate datetime format
- Normalizing and scaling data for analysis

### 2. Time Series Visualization
- **Line Charts**: To visualize energy consumption and solar generation over time
- **Rolling Averages**: To smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight trends
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: To analyze relationships between different variables

### 3. Forecasting Models
- **ARIMA Model**: Used for time series forecasting
- **Exponential Smoothing**: To identify patterns in energy trends
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing regression techniques for predictive analysis

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning and predictive modeling
- **Statsmodels**: Statistical analysis and time series forecasting
